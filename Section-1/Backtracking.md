# Backtracking
Backtracking is a technique that involves solving the problem incrementally. It is used as an upgrade to brute force, as it can get rid of many incorrect possibilities at every increment.
Because we are checking incrementally, we make use of recursion to implement it. Having a good grasp of recursion will help in understanding the algorithms. The below resources will help to give better insight.
