# C++ STL

The C++ STL (Standard Template Library) is a very powerful set of templates of classes and corresponding functions that implement many commonly used
data structures and algorithms. Some popular examples include vectors, queues, stacks, sets, and maps.

*Note: If you are not using C++ you'll want to look up the equivalents in your language and get familiar with them.*

The official C++ documentation can be found online, but the following may also be of help and provide clearer explanations.

- [Queues](https://www.techiedelight.com/queue-implementation-cpp/)
- [Stacks](https://www.techiedelight.com/stack-implementation-in-cpp/)
- [Sets](https://www.udacity.com/blog/2021/05/cpp-sets-explained.html)
- [Maps](https://www.scaler.com/topics/cpp/map-in-cpp/)

Some other useful STL members that you can look up include dequeues, priority queues, and the functioning of iterators.

Policy based data structures can also be very useful though not a part of STL (optional)
