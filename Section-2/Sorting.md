# Sorting

Sorting is one of the most fundamental techniques in all of programming. There are many standard sorting techniques that you should look through and understand the working of (need not code them). These include [bubble sort](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/bubble-sort), [selection sort](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/selection-sort), [insertion sort](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/insertion-sort), [merge sort](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/merge-sort), [quick sort](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/quick-sort), [counting sort](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/counting-sort), and [heap sort](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/heap-sort). You should also be familiar with time complexities (both worst case and average).

For the purpose of coding problems it is recommended to use **STL sort**. This will automatically sort the inputted array/vector using an optimal algorithm to run in worst case **O(nlogn)**.
