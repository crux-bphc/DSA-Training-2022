# Time & Space Complexity

One of the most important aspects of solving problems is time and space complexity. Any problem will have both a runtime limit and a memory limit. So even if your solution works and provides the correct answer every time, it may not meet the required limits of the problem. Thus, it is critical to have a solid understanding of complexities to solve problems. We use the Big-O notation to describe complexities of different solutions.



Some things to keep in mind (these will make more sense as you practice more):

- Think about time and space (not as important) complexities as you write your code. With practice this will start to become second nature.
- The constraints of the problems usually reflect the expected complexities. You can assume that:
  - Approximately **10<sup>8</sup>** operations take one second of run time
  - Approximately **5*10<sup>7</sup>** `int`s worth of memory can be used. Remember that `long long` uses more memory.
- If you are using inbuilt functions (from STL for example) remember that youâ€™ll have to factor in their time complexities when calculating the complexity of the overall solution.
