# Binary Trees

A binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most 2 children, referred to as the left and right child. The topmost node is called the root.

# Binary Search Tree (BST)

A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree that the binary search property: the key in each node must be greater than or equal to any key in its left subtree, and less than or equal to any key in its right subtree.
