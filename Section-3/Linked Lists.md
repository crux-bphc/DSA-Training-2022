# Linked Lists

Linked lists are one of the most important fundamental data structures. It is a chain of nodes each containing some data as well as a pointer to the next node. There will be a head node that points to the first node of the list, and the last node will point to NULL.

Problems involving linked lists are generally more implementation based with simple solutions. Thus it is important to have a good grip on the basics like traversal, insertion, and deletion.
