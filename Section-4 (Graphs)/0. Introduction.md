# Graphs

A graph is a data structure consisting of multiple nodes with edges connecting them. Egdes may be directed or undirected, and connect a maximum
of two nodes to eachother (egdes may also connect a node to itself).

Like DP, the variety of graph problems is highly extensive. Therefore, this section will cover a few standard algorithms that one must know to solve graph
questions. The two algorithms at the end marked 'optional' are not as widely used, but is still good to know and be able to implement them.

Be sure to practice the implementations of these algorithms thoroughly. It is important be able to code them by memory whenever you need to.
