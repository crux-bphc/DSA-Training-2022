# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest distance of every node in a graph to a specific node. It runs in a complexity of O(ElogV), where E is the number of
edges and V is the number of vertices in the graph.

It is important to note that this algorithm does not work when the graph contains negative weighted edges. For this, we use Bellman-Ford algorithm.
