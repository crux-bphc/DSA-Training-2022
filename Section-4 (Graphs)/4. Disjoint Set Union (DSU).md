# Disjoint Set Union (DSU)

DSU is a powerful data structure that allows us to view a graph as a collection of connected components. It comes with two main algorithms:

  - Finding which component a node is a part of in **O(logn)** time
  - Connecting two disjoint components in **O(1)** time

It's most notable use in is the implementation of Kruskal's Alogirthm  for finding MST (Minimum Spanning Tree).
