# Bellman-Ford Algorithm

Bellman-Ford algorithm is used to find the shortest distances of any vertex from a specific vertex, much like Dijkstra's, but it works for graphs with negative
weight cycles as well. However, it has a much slower time complexity of **O(VE)**, where V is number of vertices and E is number of edges.

It can also be used to detect negative weight cycles, as explained in the below resources.
